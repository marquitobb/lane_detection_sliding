# Lane detection sliding

## Introduction

this project is a lane detection project using sliding window technique. The project is implemented using python and opencv library. The project is implemented in two steps. In the first step, the lane lines are detected using sliding window technique. In the second step, the lane lines are drawn on the original image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9
- OpenCV
